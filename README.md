# Twitch Live Detection HTML
Hi! This is a simple JS/jQuery file that can detect whether a Twitch stream is live, by using the [New Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/).

Currently, this still works if you send the Application's Client ID, but you need to provide its own Authentication Token for this to work after April 30th 2020.
